### 虚拟语气省略if的条件从句


当虚拟条件句的谓语动词含有were, should, had时，if可省略，而将were, should, had等词置于句首，以强调假设条件的虚拟性或突出说话人的主观状态

Should he agree to go there, we would send him there. 要是他答应去的话，我们就派他去。
Were she here, she would agree with us. 如果她在这儿的话，她会同意我们的。
Had he learnt about computers, we would have hired him to work here.  如果她懂一些电脑知识的话，我们会已经聘用他来这里工作了。


> 错综复杂时间条件句

有时虚拟条件句中，主、从句的动作若不是同时发生时，即错综时间虚拟条件句。所谓错综时间虚拟条件句即条件从句与主句所指时间不一致，如从句指过去，而主句即指的是现在或将来，此时应根据具体的语境情况，结合上面提到的三种基本类型对时态作相应的调整。具体分为下面三种情况：
① 从句的动作与过去事实相反，而主句的动作与现在或现在正在发生的事实不符。
如： If I had worked hard at school, I would be an engineer, too.  如果我在学校学习刻苦的话，我现在也会使工程师了 If they had informed us, we would not come here now.  如果他们通知过我们的话，我们现在就不会来这里了。

② 从句的动作与现在事实相反，而主句的动作与过去事实不符。
如： If he were free today, we would have sent him to Beijing.  如果他今天有空的话，我们会已经派他去北京了。

If he knew her, he would have greeted her. 要是他认识她的话，他肯定会去问候她了。
③ 从句的动作与过去发生的情况相反，而主句的动作与现在正在发生的情况相反。
如： If it had not been raining too much, the crops would be growing much better.  如果天不下太多的雨的话，庄家会长得更好。

If he had been working hard, he would be working in the office now.  要是他工作一直努力的话，他现在已进了办公室了。
